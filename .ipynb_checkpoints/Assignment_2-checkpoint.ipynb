    "The task of identifying similar texts in Natural Language Processing is crucial. A naive method for determining whether two documents are similar is to treat them as collections of words (bag of words) and use the number of words they share as a proxy for their similarity. It makes sense that two books with religion as the topic (e.g.  `398.txt` and `3296.txt`) would have more words in common than a book that discusses religion and a book that discusses science fiction (e.g. books `84.txt` and `398.txt`). \n",

    "We discussed how to evaluate similarity between two texts using the number of words they share. We hypothesized that books that are similar should have more words in common than books that are dissimilar. If that holds, `book_398` and `book_3296`, which both pertain to religion, will have more words in common than, say, `book_84` and `book_398`. Test this hypothesis by writing code that compares and prints the number of words shared between `book_398` and `book_3296` and then between `book_84` and `book_398`.\n"
